  "title": "Detection of allele frequencies in the cDNA sample",
  "original description": "This protocol provides an useful technique for detecting allele frequencies in the cDNA sample",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Reverse transcription of total RNA\nReverse transcript total RNA to cDNA\n2. Primer design\nDesign the PCR primers at conserved regions between alleles, and the amplified region includes target SNP site.\n3. TaqMan probe design\nDesign two dye-labeled (FAM and VIC) TaqMan probes for allele-specific detection.\n4. Preparation of the digital PCR chip\nPrepare the reaction mix (Digital PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), forward and reverse primers, TaqMan probes, diluted DNA, and water) and load it onto the digital PCR chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n5. PCR\nPerform PCR with the following cycles: (1) 96\u00b0C, 10 min (2) 39 cycles of 56 \u00b0C, 2 min and 98\u00b0C, 30 sec and (3) 56\u00b0C, 2 min.\n6. Detection of allele frequencies\nCount the copy number of each allele by detecting fluorescence using the QuantStudioTM 3D (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n",
