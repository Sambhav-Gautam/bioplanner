  "title": "High Efficiency Transformation Protocol using NEB 10-beta Competent E. coli (C3019H)",
  "original description": "This is the correct protocol if you are using the C3019H cells. If you are using the C3019I cells, please refer to this protocol.",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Thaw a tube of NEB 10-beta Competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes. \n600s \nNOTES Cells are best thawed on ice and DNA added as soon as the last bit of ice in the tube disappears. Cells can also be thawed by hand, but warming above 0\u00b0C will decrease the transformation efficiency. \nreagents\n2. Add 1-5 \u00b5l containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.\n3. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.\n4. Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix. \n1800s \nNOTES For maximum transformation efficiency, cells and DNA should be incubated together on ice for 30 minutes. Expect a 2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 10 minutes this step is shortened.\n5. Heat shock at exactly 42\u00b0C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix. \n30s \nNOTES Both the temperature and the timing of the heat shock step are important and specific to the transformation volume and vessel. Using the transformation tube provided, 30 seconds at 42\u00b0C is optimal.\n6. Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix. \n300s\n7. Pipette 950 \u00b5l of room temperature NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium\u00a0into the mixture.\n950amount \nreagents\n8. Place at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes., shaking vigorously (250 rpm) or rotating. \n3600s \nNOTES Outgrowth at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour is best for cell recovery and for expression of antibiotic resistance. Expect a 2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 15 minutes this step is shortened. NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium gives 2-fold higher transformation efficiency than LB medium; and incubation with shaking or rotating the tube gives 2-fold higher transformation efficiency than incubation without shaking.\n9. Warm selection plates to 37\u00b0C.  \nNOTES Selection plates can be used warm or cold, wet or dry without significantly affecting the transformation efficiency. However, warm, dry plates are easier to spread and allow for the most rapid colony formation.\n10. Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.  \nreagents\n11. Perform several 10-fold serial dilutions in NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium.\nNOTES Please note that NEB no longer recommends SOC for use in this protocol. NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium is now provided with NEB 10-beta Competent E.coli and will be available also as a stand-alone product in the fall of 2017.\n12. Spread 50-100 \u00b5l of each dilution onto a selection plate\n13. Incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C \n54000s \nNOTES Alternatively, incubate at 30\u00b0C for 24-36 hours or 25\u00b0C for 48 hours.\n",
