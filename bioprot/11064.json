  "original description": "This protocol is aimed at amplifying the 16S rRNA hypervariable region 4 (16S V4) in prokaryotes. The primers (515fB\u00a0and 806rB, 926R) used in this protocol are based on the primer utilized in Apprill et al 2015 and the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP).

  "steps": "\nPCR\n1. Both forward (515F-Y) and reverse (926R) primers for the 16S rRNA gene, targeting microorganisms, were tagged yielding dual-indexed reads (Apprill et al., 2015; Kozich et al., 2013; Parada et al., 2016).\n2. PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate according to Apprill et al. (2015) with 1:10 dilutions on all extracts on a two-step fluidigm PCR protocol.\n3. For general amplification (without barcodes) 1 \u03bcl DNA template was added to the master mix consisting of \n3.9 \u03bcl sterile water\n5.0 \u03bcl 2.0X Hot Master Mix (Qiagen)\n0.05 \u03bcl of each primer\nFinal concentration of 5 \u03bcM\n4. PCR reactions were run in 96-well plates with a NTC run in triplicate for each plate.\n5. Cycling parameters:\n95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes\nThirty cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 45 seconds\n50 \u00b0C for 45 seconds\n68 \u00b0C for 90 seconds\n68 \u00b0C for 5 minutes\n6. For the secondary PCR step to attach barcodes to individual samples, 1 \u03bcl DNA template was added to the master mix consisting of \n7.0 \u03bcl sterile water\n6.0 \u03bcl 2.5X Hot Master Mix (Qiagen)\n0.5 \u03bcl of each primerA final concentration of 6 \u03bcM\n7. Secondary PCR cycling parameters:\n95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes\nFifteen cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds\n60 \u00b0C for 30 seconds\n72 \u00b0C for 1 minite\n72 \u00b0C for 3 minutes.\n\nQuality control, PCR clean-up\n8. After PCR amplification of the marker region, the pooled PCR products were run through an agarose gel to confirm the presence of target bands and\u00a0absense of non-specific amplification across environmental samples as well as the absence of amplification in no-template controls (NTCs).\n9. PCR products were purified and size selected using the Agencourt AMPure XP bead system (Beckman Coulter, USA).\n10. A second agarose gel was run to confirm primer removal and retention of target amplicons after purification.\n11. Purified products were then quantified using Quant-It Picogreen dsDNA Assay (Life Technologies) on an fmax Molecular Devices Fluorometer with SoftMaxPro v1.3.1.\n12. Equimolar pools were constructed and quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS kit to confirm pool concentration prior to library preparation.\n13. One library was constructed for each location sampled in using the KAPA HyperPrep and Library Quantification kits following manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nSequencing\n14. Sequencing was performed at the Research Technology Support Facility (RTSF) Genomics Core at Michigan State University (MSU).\n15. The pooled product was loaded on a standard MiSeq v2 flow cell and sequenced in a 2x250bp paired end format using a v2 500-cycle MiSeq reagent cartridge.\n16. The MiSeq run was performed with a 10% PhiX spike.\n17. Custom sequencing primers were added to appropriate wells of the reagent cartridge.\n18. Base calling was done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.18.54 and output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.18.0.\n",
