Open the mouse, dissect\u00a0the thoracic aorta. Take the lower half portion, rinse in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n4. Remove the adventitia (use microscope to guide), rinse in PBS.\n5. Blot to dry with a paper towel, quickly transfer to liquid N2 to freeze.\n\nStorage\n6. Store\u00a0at -80\u00baC until used.\n-80temperature\n",
