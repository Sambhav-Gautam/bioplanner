  "title": "Polarity Hybrid Chemical Tag & IHC for Adult CNS",
  "original description": "The use of genetically encoded \u2018self-labeling tags\u2019 with chemical fluorophore ligands enables rapid labeling of specific cells in neural tissue. To improve the chemical tagging of neurons, we synthesized and evaluated new fluorophore ligands based on Cy, Janelia Fluor, Alexa Fluor, and ATTO dyes and tested these with recently improved Drosophila melanogaster transgenes. We found that tissue clearing and mounting in DPX substantially improves signal quality when combined with specific non-cyanine fluorophores. We compared and combined this labeling technique with standard immunohistochemistry in the Drosophila brain.",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Dissect: Dissect adult brains or CNS in cold Schneider\u2019s Insect Medium (S2).\n2. Fix: Transfer tissue to 2 mL Protein LoBind tubes filled with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in S2 at RT. Fix for 55 minutes at RT while nutating.\n3. Post-fix wash/permeabilization: Remove the fix and add 1.75 mL phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBT) and wash for 10-15 minute washes while nutating. Perform up to 3 additional washes if waiting to add chemical tag. Samples may be held in PBT for up to 7 hours prior to chemical tagging.\n4. Chemical tag labeling: Remove PBT and add 200 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5M Cy2 Snap ligand in PBT per tube. Incubate for 15 minutes at RT on a rotator with tubes upright.Cy2 Snap ligand (2 \u00b5L/mL for final concentration of 2 \u00b5M)\n5. Post-chemical tag washes: Remove the chemical tag and do a brief rinse with 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Allow the tissue to settle to the bottom and then remove the rinse solution and add 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Wash for a total of 2 X 10-minute washes while nutating.\n6. Block in GS: Remove PBT and add 200 \u00b5L of 5% GS in PBT per tube. Incubate for 1.5 hours at RT on a rotator with tubes upright.\n7. Neuron primary antibodies: Remove block and add primary antibodies diluted in 5% GS in PBT for a volume of 200 \u00b5L per tube. Incubate for 4 hours at RT on a rotator with tubes upright. Then continue incubation at 4\u00b0C on a rotator with tubes upright for 2 overnights.Antibodies:\nRat \u03b1-FLAG Tag (1:100 or 10 \u00b5L/mL)\nRabbit \u03b1-HA Tag (1:600 or 1.67 \u00b5L/mL)\n8. Post-neuron primary washes: Remove the neuron primary antibodies and do a brief rinse with 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Allow the tissue to settle to the bottom and then remove the rinse solution and add 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Wash for a total of 3 X 30-minute washes while nutating (or 4 X 15 minutes).\n9. Neuron secondary antibodies: Remove the PBT and add the secondary antibodies diluted in 5% GS in PBT for a volume of 200 \u00b5L per tube. Incubate for 4 hours at RT on a rotator with tubes upright. Then continue incubation at 4\u00b0C on a rotator with tubes upright for 2-3 overnights.Antibodies:\nATTO 647N Goat \u03b1-Rat (1:150 or 6.6 \u00b5L/mL)\nCy3 Goat \u03b1-Rabbit (1:1000 or 1 \u00b5L/mL)\n10. Post-secondary washes: Remove the secondary antibodies and do a brief rinse with 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Allow the tissue to settle to the bottom and then remove the rinse solution and add 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Wash for a total of 3 X 30-minute washes while nutating (or 4 x 15 minutes). If needed, store tissue in 0.5% PBT at 4\u00b0C while nutating or lay tube flat and rotate.\n11. Pre-embedding fixation: Remove PBT and add 1.75 mL 4% PFA in PBS at RT. Fix for 4 hours at RT while nutating.\n12. Post-4% PFA washes: Remove the 4% PFA and do a brief rinse with 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Allow the tissue to settle to the bottom and then remove the rinse solution and add 1.75 mL 0.5% PBT. Wash for a total of 4 X 15-minute washes while nutating. If needed, store tissue in 0.5% PBT at 4\u00b0C while nutating or lay tube flat and rotate.\n13. Mount: Mount the tissue on a poly-L-lysine (PLL) coated cover glass.\u2022 For making PLL see FlyLight Recipe \u2013 Poly-L-Lysine.\n14. Dehydrate: Move the cover glass through a series of 7 cover glass staining jars filled with increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 100%, 100%, 100%). Soak the cover glass for 10 minutes in each jar.\n15. Xylene clearing: (IN THE HOOD). Move the cover glass through a series of 3 jars filled with xylene. Soak the cover glass for 5 minutes in each jar.\n16. DPX embedding: Add 7 drops of dibutyl phthalate in xylene (DPX) on top of the tissue mounted on the cover glass. Place the cover glass (DPX down) on a prepared slide with spacers. Use the edge of a glass slide to gently press down on the center of the cover glass to seat the cover glass onto the slide. Let the slide dry in the hood for 2 days before viewing.\n",
