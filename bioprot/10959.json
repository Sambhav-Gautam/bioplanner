  "title": "Unthawing RAW264.7 cells",
  "original description": "RAW264.7 cells are a macrophage-like cell line derived from BALB/c mice.\u00a0 These cells are loosely adherant and can be detached from cell culture flasks by light shaking or use of TrypLE (or Trypsin/EDTA).\u00a0\u00a0",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Pre-warm Complete Media in 37 degree C water bath or in the CO2 incubator (space permitting)reagents\n2. Thaw the vial.  Gentle agitation in a 37 deg C water bath.  You can also hold the vial tightly in your hand.  Check the label to ensure you have the correct cell line.  Avoid getting the vial wet to avoid contamination.\n3. Decontaminate vial by spraying with 70% ethanol.\n4. Transfer Cells.  In the hood:\u00a0 Use a micropipette (with sterile tip) to transfer cell suspension to sterile 15mL tube containing 15mL pre-warmed complete DMEM.\n5. Centrifuge Cells. \nSpin cells at 200-300x g (a.k.a. RCF) for 5 minutes. Make sure the centrifuge is balanced.\n6. Remove supernatant.\nDecant\u00a0into a beaker in the laminar flow hood. Resuspend cells in 1mL Complete DMEM.\n7. Transfer the vial contents to a flask.\nUse a serological pipette to transfer the resuspended cells to a flask containing 5mL Complete Media (T25) or 15mL Complete Media (T75)\n8. Inspect cell density and viability under the inverted microscope.\n9. Place culture in 37 deg C 5% CO2 incubator.\n10. Slightly loosen cap of flask to allow gas exchange.\n",
