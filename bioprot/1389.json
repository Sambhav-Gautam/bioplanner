  "original description": "This protocol is suitable for both endogeneous and overexpressed protein immunoprecipitations.",
  "steps": "\nNone\n1. Take cell dishes out of incubator and pre-cool on ice.  \nNOTES Step 1~ 7 are for IP lysate preparation.\n2. Rinse cells gently with ice-cold PBS for twice.  \nreagents\n3. Scrape cells and spin down @ 500 rpm, 10min, 4 \u00b0C.\n4. Add 500l ul IP lysis buffer to each cell pellets (upto 2E+7 cells).  \nNOTES Lysis Buffer: TrisHCl (PH8.0) 20mM NaCl               300mM EDTA               0.5mM  Na3VO4         1mM  NaF                 50mM  NP-40              1% TritonX-100     1%   Add protease inhibitors before using. \nNOTES ?IP lysis buffer recipe\n5. Rotate for 2h at 4\u00b0C. Centrifuge 14,000rpm for 30 min. Save supernatant.\n6. (Optional) Roughly determine protein concentration with OD280. Adjust all samples to the same concentration.\n7. Determine amount of beads needed (Rockland True Blot IP beads; 20 ul beads per 500ul sample).\n8. Wash beads in 1ml lysis buffer for twice. Spin down @500g, 30s.  \nNOTES Step 8~11 are for IP beads preparation.\n9. Resuspend pelleted beads in 1mg/ml BSA , rotate @ RT, 10min.\n10. Remove BSA and wash beads in lysis buffer for 3 times.\n11. Resuspend pelleted beads 1:1 with lysis buffer.\n12. Save 40ul of IP lysate per sample as input.  \nNOTES Step 12~16 are for the IP process.\n13. Add primary Ab and beads to IP lysate.\n14. Rotate @4 degree for overnight.\n15. Pellet beads @ 500g for 30sec @RT and discard the supernatant.\n16. Wash beads in 1ml ice-cold lysis buffer. Repeat 3 times.\n17. Resuspend beads in 30ul of 2\u00d7 loading buffer.  \nNOTES Step 17~20 are for SDS-PAGE sample preparation.\n18. Boil the beads for 5min.\n19. Centrifuge @ RT for 1min.\n20. Save supernatant and perform SDS-PAGE.  \nNOTES WELL DONE & GOOD LUCK!\n",
