  "steps": "\nNone\n1. Use 13-\u00d7-100\u2013mm culture tubes (or 24-well plates).\n2. Prepare exponentially growing target cells (e.g., >100 mL).\n3. Dilute some of the titered lysate to 1 infective virus/mL.\n4. Add 0.2 mL (0.2 infectious units) to each of 20 tubes of susceptible host cells.\n5. Monitor tubes for 2 to 3 weeks.\n6. Cultures in which lysis occurs are assumed to be the result of a single-virus infection.  \nNOTES The probability that more than 1 infective unit occurred in a given culture is 0.0176.\n7. If lysis occurs in 4 tubes or less of 20, it is assumed that\u00a0lysis in each tube was caused by one infectious unit, therefore each tube would contain a separate phage clone.\n8. Propagate an aliquot from all the tubes to confirm the results.\n9. If lysis occurs in more than 4 tubes, repeat the clone out procedure by reducing the volume of diluted lysate added to the 20 tubes.  \nNOTES Add 0.1 mL instead of 0.2 mL.\n10. Scale up each phage clone to make primary phage stocks.  \nNOTES e.g., add 5\u00b5L of the lysate to 40 mL of cells.\n11. Centrifuge, filter, and titer the stock, store at 4\u00b0C in the dark.\n",
