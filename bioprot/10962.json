  "original description": "Counting cells with a hemocytometer is an easy way to\u00a0determine\u00a0relatively accurate numbers of viable cells.\u00a0 After determining cell counts, cells can be passaged, frozen away, or used for an experiment at a particular density.\u00a0\u00a0",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Collect cell suspension\nCell suspension must be in a known volume.\u00a0 Adherent cells can be detached by methods appropriate for your particular cell line.\n2. Dilute an aliquot of cells in Trypan Blue\nUse a 1:10 dilution for many cells, 1:2 dilution if working with fewer cells\nNeed a total volume of 10ul; Can do 10ul of cell suspension into 90ul Trypan Blue (1:10) to ensure plenty of excess cells and limit pipetting errors associated with pipetting volumes less than 10 ul\n3. Add cells to hemocytometer\nUsing a P10 micropipette, transfer 10ul of cell suspension + Trypan Blue under the cover slip on a hemocytometer\n4. Count Cells\nObserve the hemocytometer under the compound microscope\nCount the cells within the squares\nCount cells on 2 of the 4 perimeter lines\nOnly count live (non-blue) cells\nValid counts should include at least 50 cells\nimageblocka\n5. Calculate cell concentration\nCells/mL = (Cell count)/(number of chambers counted) x dilution x 104\nEX: If you diluted your cells 1:10 in trypan blue, counted chambers 1 and 4, and counted a total of 150 cells:150/2 = 75 x 10 x 104 = 7.5 x 106 cells/mLNOTE: Concentration (cells/mL) x total volume (mL) = total number of cells\n",

  "ai_generated_description": "The objective of this molecular biology protocol is to determine relatively accurate numbers of viable cells using a hemocytometer, which can then be used for passaging, freezing, or conducting experiments at specific densities. The protocol involves diluting cell suspension in Trypan blue, counting live cells under a microscope, and calculating cell concentration.",
