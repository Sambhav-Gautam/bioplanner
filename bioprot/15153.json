  "original description": "Preparation of\u00a0Zymoseptoria tritici long-term storage on silica gel. Rodney Pettway 1992, ed. Petteri Karisto 2018.",
  "steps": "\nPreparation of the silica gel\n1. Always begin by baking (dry sterilization) a fresh batch of silica gel powder before preparing tubes. [Optional: Mix 1 part indicator silica gel with 9 parts silica gel (10% indicator gel by volume).] Place in shallow layer in baking tray or glass beaker and dry heat sterilize in oven at 190 C for 3-4 hours. [Transfer dried, sterilized silica gel to sterile glass beaker]. Cover the beaker tightly with foil, and allow to cool to room temperature for approx. 30 minutes.\n\nPreparation of the tubes\n2. Sterilize some 2 ml screw top vials in autoclave. Be sure these are absolutely dry before using them.\n\nFill tubes with silica gel\n3. Add silica gel to within one centimeter of the bottom thread on the screw top vial. Use a funnel to add silica gel to vials. Label tubes.\n\nAdd spores in the tubes\n4. Add 150 microliters of a fresh spore (or yeast cells) solution to the silica gel vials. Be sure to mix spores well before pipetting up sample. Disperse the spores over the silica gel by shaking the vial and rapping with your finger with the top loosely screwed down. After the spores are well-dispersed (max 15 sec), screw the top down as tight as possible, and transfer immediately to the ice bucket. Leave the vials in the ice bucket until all isolates have been transferred to silica gel tubes.\n\nStore the tubes\n5. Place isolates in a labelled storage box. [Optional additional protection: place the storage boxes in a container with approx. two cups of fresh siliga gel in the bottom. Label outside of the container with description of isolates in the container.] Store the isolates in -80 degrees Celsius. Properly stored isolates can be safely stored for at least 10-15 years.\n\nUsing the isolates\n6. Transfer spore clump from the tube on agar plate and spread on the plate to get fresh colonies. Check indicator crystals in tube after every time they are opened. If all indicator crystals indicate humidity, prepare a fresh long-term storage vial for this isolate.\n",
