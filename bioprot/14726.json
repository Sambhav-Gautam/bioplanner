  "original description": "This protocol is widely used in serum biochemical indexes detection, it provides an rapid and reliable technique for obtaining relative concentrations of multiple blood biochemical indices simultaneously.",
  "steps": "\nBlood Samples Collection\n1. Blood samples (180 - 200 mL per tail) from 10 Ctenopharyngodon idellus per each group were taken from caudal vein without an anti-coagulating substance by injector puncture.\n\nPreparation for Serum samples\n2. The blood samples were placed at room temperature for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n\nStorage of samples\n3. The separated serum was stored at -80 \u2103 until the serum biochemical indexes detection and analysis.\n\nSerum Samples Detection\n4. The lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic-oxalacetic tansaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, high density cholesterol, glucose, albumin, total protein and triglycerides were measured by automatic biochemistry analyzer (Hitachi 7020, Hitachi High Technologies, Inc., Ibaraki, Japan).\n\nThe used test Kit\n5. Test kits (the standard samples of serum biochemical indexes) were purchased from the Nanjing Jiancheng Biochemical Corporation (Nanjing Jiancheng Biochemical Corporation, Nanjing, China), and the entire procedure was performed in accordance with the kit instructions.\n",
