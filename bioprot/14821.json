  "title": "Intracellular Cytokine Staining",
  "original description": "This protocol outlines the steps used for Intracellular cytokine staining.   In brief: Cells were treated with protein transport inhibitor containing Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug; cat: 555029, BD) and plated at 1e6 cells per well in a 96-well flat bottom plate. Cells were stimulated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C with either T cell media, Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (Sigma, cat: P8139) (used at 20ng/mL) and Ionomycin (Sigma, cat: I0634)(used at 1mg/mL), or 1mg/mL of peptide (as indicated). Msln406-414 (GQKMNAQAI), OTI (SIINFEKL), LCMVgp33-41 (KAVYNFATM), MSLN20-28 (SLLFLLFSL), and MSLN530-538 (VLPLTVAEV) peptides were ordered from ELIM peptide (>80% purity). The BD Fix/Perm kit (cat: 554714) was used for intracellular staining. Cells were fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde until data acquisition.",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Prepare a flat bottom 96 well plate. Resuspend cells at 10e6 cells/ml in T cell media. Transfer at least 350ul of cells per condition into a fresh tube (you want at least 3 replicate wells at 100ul/well for each condition).\n2. Dilute Golgi Plug to 1:50 (2mg/ml) in cells for the experiment. (Once the treatment condition is added the final concentration will be 1:100 = 1mg/ml)\n3. Plate 100ul of cells per well.\n4. Dilute the PMA (prepare at 40ng/mL PMA so that the final concentration in the assay will be 20ng/mL) and Ionomycin (prepare at 2mg/mL Ionomycin so that the final concentration in the assay will be 1mg/mL) in one tube of media.\nResuspend peptide at 2ug/100ul.\n5. Add 100ul of media or PMA/I or peptide to each well.\u00a0 Incubate 4-6 hours in 37\u00b0C incubator.\n6. Transfer cells to U-bottom 96 well plate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - at this step, you can combine the replicate wells if you were low on cells.\n7. Centrifuge (Cfg) plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with high brake) + dump supernatant.\n8. Add 50ul Live/Dead stain per well (dilute 5ul of dye in 2.5ml 1x DPBS).\n9. Incubate for 20-30 minutes in fridge at 4oC (dark).\n10. Add 100 ul of FACS Buffer per well to wash. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with high brake) + dump supernatant.\n11. Prepare cocktail of antibodies for cell surface stain. Add 50-75uL of surface stain mix per well. Resuspend pellet by pipetting up + down at least 5x.\n12. Incubate plates 30 min in fridge at 4oC (dark).\n13. Add 100 ul of FACS Buffer per well to wash. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with high brake) + dump supernatant.\n14. Add 150 ul of FACS Buffer per well to wash a second time. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with high brake) + dump supernatant.\n15. Add 150 ul of FACS Buffer per well to wash a third time. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with high brake) + dump supernatant.\n16. Add 100 ul of Fixation/Permeabilization solution per well. Resuspend pellet by pipetting up + down at least 5x. Incubate plate 20 minutes at 4oC in fridge (dark).\n17. Add 100 ul of Perm/Wash Buffer (PWB) per well to wash. CHANGE BREAK to SETTING 2 for all remaining centrifugation steps.\n18. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with brake = 2) + dump supernatant.\n19. Add 150 ul of Perm/Wash Buffer per well to wash a second time. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with brake = 2) + dump supernatant.\n20. Add 150 ul of Perm/Wash Buffer per well to wash a third time. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with brake = 2) + dump supernatant.\n21. Prepare cocktail of antibodies in PWB buffer for Intracellular stain. Add 50-75uL of intracellular stain mix per well. Resuspend pellet by pipetting up + down at least 5x.\n22. Incubate plate 30 minutes at 4oC in fridge (dark).\n23. Add 100 ul of Perm/Wash Buffer (PWB) per well to wash. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with brake = 2) + dump supernatant.\n24. Add 150 ul of Perm/Wash Buffer per well to wash a second time. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with brake = 2) + dump supernatant.\n25. Add 150 ul of Perm/Wash Buffer per well to wash a third time. Cfg plate at 4oC for 2 min @809xg (with brake = 2) + dump supernatant.\n26. Resuspend in 200 ul of 0.5% PFA (can leave overnight at this step). Store in fridge at 4oC until acquisition. Run samples on the flow cytometer within 24 hours for best results.\n",
