  "steps": "\n\n1. \u0001 Inoculate single colony of freshly transformed DH5\u0003Pro or TOP10 cells in 4 ml LB medium containing\n2. 50\u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol (or appropriate antibiotic).\n3. \u0001 Grow the culture overnight at 37 C with shaking (250 rpm).\n4. \u0001 Next day re-inoculate the cultures into 4 ml fresh LB medium having antibiotics and varying inducer\n5. concentrations. Inducer concentrations can be varied from 0-1mM of IPTG or 0-200 ng/ml aTc.\n6. \u0001 Collect the samples at different time intervals of 3, 6 and 9 hours.\n7. \u0001 Monitor the growth rate by measuring optical density at 600 nm.\n8. \u0001 Measure the fluorescence in a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon\n9. laser and a 515-545 nm emission filter (FL-1) and a 585-610 nm emission filter (FL-2).\n10. \u0001 To measure the fluorescence, add 3-5 \u03bcl of the growing culture in ~1 ml PBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH-7.5).\n11. Measurement should be done at low flow rate (~1000 events/second).\n12. \u0001 For each sample, collect 50,000 events.\n13. \u0001 Analyze the fluorescence in both FL-1 and FL-2 channel using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).\n14. \u0001 Determine the background fluorescence by using controls (cells having empty plasmid vector).\n15. \n",

  "ai_generated_description": "This molecular biology protocol aims to perform flow cytometry on bacterial cultures that have been transformed with a plasmid of interest. The objective is to monitor their fluorescence as a function of inducer concentration and growth time, which will help in understanding gene expression dynamics in response to different environmental conditions.",
