  "original description": "This protocol outlines the steps for isolating murine T cells from mouse blood, ascites, spleen, and ID8 tumors.   In brief: Spleens were disrupted by mechanical force through a 70mm filter (BD Falcon, ref: 352350) and red blood cells lysed using ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, cat: A1049201). Ovarian tumors were excised and normal adjacent tissue removed. Tumors were minced using a GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi), incubated for 10 minutes on a rotator (Miltenyi) at 37\u00b0C (medium spin setting), disrupted through a 70mm filter, washed with RPMI containing 5% FBS, and lymphocytes were purified on a 44/67% Percoll gradient (800xg at 23\u00b0C for 20 minutes; GE Healthcare, cat: 17-0891-01).",
  "steps": "\nSpleen digestion\n1. 1. Harvest cells by smashing spleen through a 70um filter.\n2. Spin down cells at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\n3. Remove supernatant and lyse red blood cells with 2 mL ACK lysis buffer for 2 minutes at room temperature.\n4. Quench lysis using 10mL T cell media.\n5. Spin down cells at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\u00a0\n6. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in T cell media. Store on ice until use.\n\nBlood and Ascites digestion\n2. 1. Spin down cells at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\n2. Remove supernatant and lyse red blood cells with 2 mL ACK lysis buffer for 2 minutes at room temperature.\n3. Quench lysis using 2mL T cell media. Spin down cells at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\u00a0\n4. Remove supernatant and lyse red blood cells a second time with 2 mL ACK lysis buffer for 2 minutes at room temperature.\n5. Quench lysis using 2mL T cell media. Spin down cells at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\u00a0\n6. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in T cell media. Store on ice until use.\n\nID8 ovary tumor digestion\n3. 1. Excise tumor from animal and remove normal tissue. Be sure to remove any lymph nodes from tumor! Store in RPMI containing 5% FBS on ice until processing.\n2. Transfer tumor tissue into 3mL RPMI+5%FBS in a GentleMACs C tube.\n3. Mince tumors using a GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi). Use protocol 'm_imptumor_01'.\n4. Transfer tissue to a 50 mL conical tube. Add 35 mL of collagenase (pre-warmed to 37C).\n5. Put tubes on a MACS Mix Rotator and place in the 37C incubator rotating on medium speed for 10 minutes.\n6. Spin down tubes at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\u00a0\n7. Remove supernatant and resuspend tissue in 5mL RPMI+5%FBS. Smash sample through a 70um filter.\n8. Spin down tubes at 369xg for 4-5 minutes at 4C.\u00a0\n9. Resuspend pellet in 5mL of 44% Percoll.\n10. Underlay with 3-5mL of 67% Percoll.\n11. Spin samples for 20 minutes at 809xg at room temperature with NO BRAKE.\n12. Remove and discard fat layer floating on top. Gently remove the cells at the interface and transfer to a fresh tube.\n13. Wash cells with 15mL RPMI+5% FBS. Spin cells at 518xg for 10 minutes at 4C.\n14. Remove supernatant. Resuspend cells in either RPMI+5% FBS and store on ice until use, or proceed directly to cell staining for FACS.\n",
