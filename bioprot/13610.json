  "title": "APX2 induction via herbicide infiltration (DCMU, DBMIB, Methyl Viologen)",
  "original description": "Infiltration of leaves\u00a0with various herbicides, targetting photosynthetic electron transport, were utilized to mimic changes in redox state (otherwise caused by changes in light irradiance)\u00a0of photosynthetic electron transport components and study the response of APX2.\u00a0   This was successfully\u00a0 utilized in the following publication:\u00a0 Jung, H., Crisp, P.A., Estavillo, G.M., Cole, B., Hong, F., Mockler, T.C., Pogson, B.J., and Chory, J. (2013). Subset of heat-shock transcription factors required for the early response of Arabidopsis to excess light. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 110: 14474\u201314479.",
  "steps": "\n\n1. Grow plants under low - moderate light conditions (60 \u2013 100 \u00b5M, make sure this is measured).\n2. Excise leaf of plant (use surgical scizzors if possible to ensure a clean cut, alternatively can perform hole puncture) and float on the surface of water (in petri dish with known water level so that concentration of herbicide used is accurate = 15 mL water used for concentrations below).\n3. Incubate\u00a0excised leaves at\u00a0light conditions used in #1 for approximately 5 hours.\n4. Make fresh herbicide solutions (dissolve in ethanol):\n50 mg DBMIB in 15 mL ethanol = 10 mM\n20 mg DCMU in 40 mL ethanol = 2 mM\n26 mg MV in 40 mL ethanol = 2.5\u00a0\u00b5M\nControl = ethanol only.\n5. Add the following volumes of prepared herbicide solution to 36 mL ethanol:\n36 \u00b5L of 10 mM DBMIB (Cf = 24 \u00b5M)\n75 \u00b5L of 2 mM DCMU (Cf = 10 \u00b5M) or\n15 \u00b5L of methyl viologen (Cf = 2.5 \u00b5M).\nAdd 36uL (or largest volume used) of ethanol only as a control.\n6. Transfer leaves to new petri dish with desired herbicide solution or control.\n7. Transfer entire petri dish with leaves into vacuum chamber and\u00a0apply pump for 3 min to setup a vacuum.\u00a0Susbequently, slowly release\u00a0pressure to facilitate uptake of herbicide solution\u00a0 into leaves (or control).\n8. Incubate leaves\u00a0(still in herbicide solution or contorl) at light conditions used in #1 for at least 2 hours.\n9. Check chlorophyll fluorescence using PAM (\u03a6PSII, qP, NPQ) to infer photosynthetic performace and/or harvest (snap-freeze & grind & store at -80 \u00b0C) leaves for further experiments.An important decision should be made here regarding whether leaves measured by PAM are also harvested for measuring gene expression (or desired emeasurement). Investigator should be consistent, but be aware that running under a PAM is essentially light stress for the leaf and will likely induce additional changes to gene expression. Previously, we\u00a0harvested independent leaves from those measured under PAM.Chlorophyll fluorescence is extracted\u00a0with\u00a0the PAM as an average across individual leaves. Thus, each leaf is considered a single biological replicate (with petri dish as a blocking factor). Single leaves (~100 mg) should give ample mRNA.\n",
