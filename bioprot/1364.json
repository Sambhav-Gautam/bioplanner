  "steps": "\n(Option A): Drying the filter by rubbing with a Kimwipe\n1. (A) Gently rub the filter back against a clean Kimwipe.  \nNOTES Rub gently and on the correct side. Do not rub the top surface of the filter as this is sample side where the microorganisms are attached.\n\n(Option B): Drying the filter using a heat block\n2. (B) After briefly blotting the back of the filter, place it on a clean glass microscope slide on top of the solid, flat side of an aluminum low-temperature dry-heat block set to 35\u201337 \u00b0C (be careful that the filters do not slide off). The heat block should be warm to the touch and no hotter than the recommended temperature.  \nNOTES When using this accelerated drying method, leave the filter no longer than 5 min on the dry heat block. This method is recommended in regions of high humidity.\n\n(Option C): Drying the filter by blotting and leaving in a dark drawer or box\n3. (C) After briefly blotting the back of the filter with a clean Kimwipe, place it backside down on another new Kimwipe in a bench drawer in the dark (in humid climates, a darkened dessicator might be a good alternative).\n4. (C) Give the filter an opacity check after 3\u20134 min to determine whether it is dry. Place it back in the drawer if any patches of translucent area remain. If you are processing a number of samples, this method seems to work best as you can filter multiple samples and place filters in the drawer to dry in small batches (four to six). By staggering the slide preparation in this way, numerous samples can be efficiently processed.\n",

  "ai_generated_description": "The objective of this scientific protocol is to provide a consistent and effective method for drying filters in molecular biology applications, specifically for the SYBR Green Assay. The protocol offers three different options for drying filters: rubbing with a Kimwipe, using a heat block, and blotting and storing in a dark drawer or box.",
