  "steps": "\nGenomic DNA interruption\n1. The extracted DNA was sheared into fragments between 50 bp and ~800 bp in size using a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Brighton, UK). Treat time 20s, Acoustic Duty Factor 25%, Peak Incident Power 500W, Cycles Per Burst 500, 24 cycles.\u00a0\n20s\n\nFragment selection\n2. Fragments between 150 bp and 250 bp or 200 to 500 bp were selected using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beverly, the U.S.).\nreagents\n\nEnd-repair\n3. Repaired using T4 DNA polymerase, (ENZYMATICS, Beverly, the U.S.) 30 min. at 20 \u2103 to obtain blunt ends which were then 3\u2019-adenlyated to create sticky ends.\nreagents \n1800s \n20temperature\n\nAdd adapter\n4. These DNA fragments were ligated at both ends to T-tailed adapters and amplified.\n\nPCR amplification \n5. The temperature profile was 3 min. at 95 \u2103 followed by 8 cycles of 20 sec. at 98 \u2103, 15 sec. at 60 \u2103, 30 sec. at 72 \u2103, and more 10 min. at 72 \u2103 for further elongation.\n\nLibrary purification\n6. AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beverly, the U.S.) was used to purify the PCR production.\n",
