  "steps": "\n\n1. Collect 1 ml Synechocystis liquid culture and spin it down at 14,000 g\u00a0for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and keep the pellets cool.\n300s\n2. Fill\u00a0a 1.5 ml Eppendorf Tube\u00a0with 400 ml glass beads (~0.5 mm) for each sample.\n3. Resuspend the pellet from step 1 in 1 ml PBS Buffer (pH = 7.4). Transfer the solution into the prepared 1.5 ml tubes filled with glass beads. Keep the solution cool.\n4. Thoroughly\u00a0vortex each sample for 1 min. Repeat the process five times. The\u00a0supernatant should become blue-green and clear.\u00a060s\n5. Spin down your vortexed sample for 5 min\u00a0at 3,000 g at 4 \u00b0C. Transfer the supernatant into a fresh 2 ml Eppendorf tube and keep the supernatant cool.\u00a0\n300s\n6. Spin down your supernatant again at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C.\u00a0\n1200s\n7. Transfer\u00a0the supernatant into a cuvette. The supernatant should appear clearly blue at this stage. Measure the extinction at 620 nm. Use PBS as a blank.\n",
