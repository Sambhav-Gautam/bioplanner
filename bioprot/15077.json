  "title": "Immunohistochemistry protocol for detection of fetuin-A via APAAP-Kit in older human autopsy tissue",
  "original description": "This staining was employed to detect Fetuin-A\u00a0 in paraffin sections (1 \u03bcm thickness) of formalin-fixed human brain tissue. For fetuin-A staining, we used a monoclonal IgG2a mouse-anti-human antibody (clone MAHS-1, dilution 0.1-0.5 \u00b5g/mL), raised against purified human fetuin-A in our laboratories. Antibodies were diluted in a 1% dilution of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were immediately applied to the re-hydrated sections. Bound antibody was detected using Dako REAL\u2122 Detection System, which employs APAAP immunochemistry and fast red chromogenic substrate (Dako K5000, Glostrup, Denmark) following the manufacturers protocol. Counterstaining was employed with Mayer\u00b4s hematoxylin solution (Roth, T160.1, one minute). The slides were then washed in demineralized water and dehydrated in graded alcohol (concentrations from 70% to 100%). After placing in xylene the sections were mounted (Roth, T160.1) and covered using coverslips.",
  "steps": "\n\n1. See Guidelines\n\nClear slides\n2. Place slides in hybridization oven: 37\u00b0C overnight, then 1 hour at 65\u00b0C\n\n\n3. Deparaffination in xylene 3x20 minutes (3 different containers) on a shaker\n4. Rehydration in graded ethanol: 3x2 minutes in 100% ethanol, followed by 2x2 minutes in 96% ethanol and at last 2 minutes in 70% ethanol\n5. Wash in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes\n\nAntigen retrieval\n6. Antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (10 mM) in a heat steamer for 30 minutes. Afterwards let the slides cool down in phosphate buffered saline for 30 minutes\n\n\n7. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes\n\nImmunostaining\n8. Encircle each tissue section with a wax pen\n\n\n9. Apply the primary antibody in 1% dilution of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, 100 \u00b5l per section (negative controls: only 1% dilution), incubation overnight in a moisture chamber\n10. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n11. Wash in PBS for 2x5 minutes\n12. Apply the secondary antibody DAKO REAL Link (APAAP Kit, bottle A) 100 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 30 minutes in a moisture chamber\n13. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n14. Wash in PBS for 2x5 minutes\n15. Apply Dako REAL APAAP Immunocomplex (APAAP Kit, bottle B), 100 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 30 minutes in a moisture chamber\n16. Tip off solution and rinse in demineralized water\n17. Wash in PBS for 2x5 minutes\n18. Prepare the substrate working solution (CHROME): To each 750 \u00b5l of AP Substrate Buffer (APAAP Kit , bottle F) add 30 \u00b5l chromogen Red 1 (APAAP Kit, bottle C), 30 \u00b5l chromogen Red 2 (APAAP Kit, bottle D) and 30 \u00b5l chromogen Red 3 (APAAP Kit, bottle D) in this exact order. Mix well and use within 20 minutes!\n19. Apply substrate working solution (CHROME), 200 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 20 minutes\n20. Wash in demineralized water for 2x5 minutes\n21. Submerge slides in Mayer\u00b4s hematoxylin for 1 minute\n22. Rinse in demineralized running water for 5 minutes\n\nDehydrate and mount slides\n23. Dehydrate in graded ethanol: 1 minute in 70% ethanol, following 1 minute in 96% ethanol and 2 minutes in 100% ethanol\n\n\n24. Place the tissue samples in xylene for 3x1 minute\n25. Coverslip using mounting medium\n",
