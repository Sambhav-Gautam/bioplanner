  "title": "Immunofluorescence staining protocol for co-staining of fetuin-A and CD68 in older human autopsy tissue",
  "original description": "This staining was performed to detect fetuin-A in activated microglia. CD68 is a marker, that stains activated microglia, macrophages and monocytes. Fetuin-A and microglia were detected in paraffin sections (1 \u03bcm thickness) of formalin-fixed human brain tissue. CD68 was stained using a monoclonal mouse-anti-human antibody (Dako Cat# M0814, RRID:AB_2314148, clone KP1, dilution 1:50) and a polyclonal goat-anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-11029, RRID:AB_2534088, dilution 1:300).\u00a0Fetuin-A was detected by using a monoclonal IgG2a mouse-anti-human antibody (clone MAHS-1, dilution 1.0 \u00b5g/mL), raised against purified human fetuin-A in our laboratories. Antibody binding was detected by tyramide signal amplification using a secondary biotinylated polyclonal goat-anti-mouse antibody (Dako Cat# E0433, RRID:AB_2687905, dilution 1:300) and a Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA, T-20933). To minimize lipofuscin autofluorescence, sections were counterstained with Sudan Black (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany, 199664, dilution 0.3% in 70% ethanol, 5 minutes). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany D9542, dilution 0.25 \u00b5g/ml, 5 minutes). Sections were mounted with Immumount (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA, 9990402) and stored at 8\u00b0C in the dark.\u00a0",
  "steps": "\nSee Guidelines\n1. Check tissue requirements and prepare the components of the Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit\n\nClear slides\n2. Place slides in hybridization oven: 37\u00b0C overnight, then 1 hour at 65\u00b0C\n\n\n3. Deparaffination in xylene 3x20 minutes (different containers) on a shaker\n4. Rehydration in graded ethanol: 3x2 minutes in 100% ethanol, followed by 2x2 minutes in 96% ethanol and at last 2 minutes in 70% ethanol\n5. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes\n\nAntigen retrieval\n6. Antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9) in a heat steamer for 30 minutes. Afterwards let the slides cool down in PBS for 30 minutes\n\n\n7. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes\n\nImmunostaining\n8. Encircle tissue section with wax pen\n\n\n9. To block non-specific binding, apply a solution of 10% goat serum in PBS, incubation for 1 hour in a moisture chamber\n10. Tip off excess solution and apply the primary anti-fetuin-A-antibody (MAHS-1, dilution 1 \u00b5g/ml in 1% BSA in PBS) 100 \u00b5l per section,\u00a0 (negative controls: only 1% dilution), incubation overnight in a moisture chamber\n11. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n12. Wash in PBS for 3x5 minutes\n13. Apply the secondary biotinylated goat-anti-mouse antibody (dilution 1:300 in 1%\u00a0 BSA in PBS), 100 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 1 hour at room temperature in a moisture chamber\n14. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n15. Wash in PBS for 3x5 minutes\n16. Apply the Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit as follows: Dilute the prior prepared HRP solution 1:100 in 1% BSA in PBS, apply 100 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 1 hour at room temperature in a moisture chamber.\n17. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n18. Wash in PBS for 3x5 minutes\n19. Prepare a tyramide working solution following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol: dilute the prior prepared tyramide stock solution 1:100 in the prepared 0.0015% hydrogen peroxid solution\n20. Apply 100 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 10 minuteskeep the tissue samples from now on light protected!\n21. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n22. Wash in PBS for 3x5 minutes\n23. Apply the primary anti-CD68 antibody (dilution 1:50 in 1% BSA in PBS), 100 \u00b5l per section (negative controls: only 1% dilution), incubation overnight in a moisture chamber\n24. Apply the polyclonal goat-anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:300 in 1% BSA in PBS), 100 \u00b5l per section, incubation for 90 minutes at room temperature in a moisture chamber\n25. Tip off excess solution and rinse in demineralized water\n26. Wash in PBS for 3x5 minutes\n27. To minimize lipofuscin autofluorescence, perform counterstaining with Sudan Black (dilution 0.3% in 70% ethanol) for 5 minutes\n28. Rinse the container with demineralized water until the solution becomes clear and colorless\n29. Wash in demineralized water for 3x5 minutes\n30. Counterstain with DAPI (dilution 0.25 \u00b5g/ml) for 5 minutes\n31. Wash in PBS for 3x5 minutes\n32. Coverslip using mounting medium\n33. Store at 8\u00b0C in the dark\n",
