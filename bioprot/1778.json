  "title": "1% SDS in DNA Buffer",
  "original description": "This buffer is used to stabilize samples for archiving and subsequentgenomic DNA extraction.\u00a0  SDS is dissolved to a concentration of 1% (w/v) in DNAB (DNA buffer: 0.4 M NaCl +\u00a00.05 M\u00a0EDTA in MilliQ water). The buffer may need to be warmed for SDS to completely dissolve. Tissue samples are\u00a0added to small aliquots of 1% SDS in DNAB and heated to 65\u00b0C for 60-90 minutes. They are then stable at room temperature and ready for extraction of genomic DNA.",
  "steps": "\nNone\n1. Prepare stock solution of 4 M Sodium chloride in MilliQ water  \nreagents\n2. Prepare stock solution of 0.5 M EDTA\u00a0in MilliQ water  \nreagents\n3. Mix 50 mL 4 M NaCl and 50 mL 0.5 M EDTA\n4. Make up to a final volume of 500 mL with MilliQ water  \nreagents\n5. Dissolve SDS in DNA Buffer to a final concentration of 1% (w/v).\ne.g., 5 g SDS in 500 mL of DNA Buffer.  \nreagents\n",
